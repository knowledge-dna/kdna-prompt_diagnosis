# Known Limitations

This document declares known limitations of the kdna-prompt_diagnosis domain judgment package.
This is required by the [KDNA Governance Policy](https://github.com/aikdna/KDNA/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Scope Limitations
- This domain's judgment is bounded to its declared field: prompt_diagnosis.
- The axioms, signals, and self-checks are designed for the current version of this domain.
  They may not generalize to adjacent fields without adaptation.

## Content Limitations
- Not all edge cases in this field are covered. Domain expertise is encoded as structured
  principles, not as exhaustive rule sets.
- The quality badge reflects current evaluation data. As evaluation methodology improves,
  quality badges may be revised.

## Technical Limitations
- KDNA provides judgment context, not execution. The agent using this domain is responsible
  for correct application.
- Domain conflicts are reported but not automatically resolved. When multiple domains
  apply to the same task, the agent must navigate conflicting guidance.

## Review Status
Current review status and quality badge are defined in the registry entry.
See [aikdna/kdna-registry](https://github.com/aikdna/kdna-registry) for the latest metadata.

## Reporting
To report limitations not documented here, please open an issue on this repository.
